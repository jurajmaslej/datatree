    "### 3. Idei pre klasifikáciu platieb\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Grafová štruktúra\n",
    "Prvotný nápad bol vytvoriť grafovú štruktúru kde by účty boli vrcholy a platby hrany. Tento prístup by vyžadoval prehľadávanie grafovými algoritmami. Pri skúmaní use-case-ov pre fyzické osoby sme nenarazili na masívne výhody tohto prístupu pre identifikáciu miezd. Výhodami by bola možna práca s tranzitívnosťou údajov, teda možná identifikácia reťazcov platieb. Táto grafová štruktúra by bola vyvinutá ako ďalší krok po terajšom riešení.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Použité riešenie\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre fyzické osoby sme mali predpoklad, že mzda bude prichádzať z jedného účtu, teda aj bez reťazcov platieb neprídeme o veľa informácie. Implementovali sme slovník, ktorý obsahuje objekt triedy udržiavajúcej detaily o platbách medzi účtami, v priebehu výpočtu nové dáta a nakoniec aj výsledok vo forme pravdepodobnosti. Pre vyššiu presnosť riešeniu sme sa snažili vyhýbať pevným ohraničeniam, teda výsledky uvádzame v pravdepodobnosti. Pre určenie mzdy sme ale použili niekoľko logických ohraničení ako výšku platby a jej periodicitu.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3 Klasifikácia ďalších kategórii\n",
    "\n",
    "Jednoduche kategórie, ako kategorizáciu podľa výšky platieb sme neimplementovali, pretože sme to považovali za triviálne. Platby ako predaj tovaru medzi fyzickými osobami by sme vyhľadávali opačným postupom ako mzdy, teda platby ktoré nemajú žiadnu periodicitu a variancia ich sumy je vysoká. Ak ma fyzická osoba druhý príjem z 2. zamestnania, mohla by ho odhaliť ďalej navrhnutá a implementovaná klasterizácia.\n",

    "### 4. Rozhodovanie na základe sumy a periodicity platieb - prvý prístup\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1. Idea\n",
    "   Aby bola platba klasifkovaná ako výplata, zvažujeme v tomto prístupe periodicitu platby a varianciu vo výške platieb. Pre každý prvok v slovníku payments, teda dvojicu účtov, kde z účtu A odchádzajú platby na účet B, vypočítame rozdiel v dátume platieb.Čím je priemer týchto rozdielov vzdialenejší od počtu dní v mesiaci, tým väčšia pravdepodobnosť, že dané platby neboli výplatami. Variancu vo vyplácaných sumách získame ako štandardnú odchýlku deleno priemer platieb. Čím väčšia variancia, tým nižšia pravdepodobnosť, že ide o výplaty.\n",
    "Ak sa chyba v časoch platieb a suma platieb pohybuje v stanovených medziach, chyby zaznamenáme. V ďalšej metóde následne pre dvojice účtov kde máme zaznamenú chybu, prevedieme chybu na pravdepodobnosť, že sa jedná o výplaty\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2. Nevýhody\n",
    "   Hlavným problémom tohto prístupu, je vyhodnotenie buď všetkých platieb medzi 2 účtami ako mzdy, alebo kvôli niekoľkým platbam nevyhovujúcej sumy, alebo v inom dátume vyhodnotenie, že pre žiadnu platbu sa nejedná o mzdu. Medzi dvomi účtami sa môžu medzi mzdami vyskytnúť rôzne transakcie, toto tento prístup neberie do úvahy.\n",

    "Mzdy budú silne viazané na periodicitu cca 1 mesiaca, medzi nimi môžu nastať iné platby. Tie ale pravdepodobne nebudú nastávať s mesačnou periodicitou. Pôvodná idea bolo nájsť sekvencie opakujúcich sa platieb a ich periódu opakovania. Kvôli krátkosti času sme použili zjednodušené riešenie. \n",

    "Nájdeme priemer z dní v mesiaci v ktorých prichádzajú platby na účet, predpokladáme, že mzdy kvôli podobným dátumom budú mať najvyššiu váhu a priemer im bude blízky. Tento predpoklad sa nám potvrdil. Následné vypočítame odchýlku platieb od priemeru a štandardnú varianciu dátumov platieb.\n",
    "Na základe týchto parametrov sa rozhodneme či platbu (nie celý sled platieb ako pri predošlom prístupe), zaradíme do ďalšieho vyhodnocovania. Čím menšia celková odchýlka od priemeru a menšia variancia, tým je väčšia pravdepodobnosť, že sa jedná o mzdu. Pre väčšiu selektívnosť v tejto fáze taktiež zohľadnujeme výšku platby, ktorá musí byť vo vopred stanovených hraniciach. Takisto variancia dátumov nesmie prekročiť stanovenú hranicu. Po prekročení tejto hranice variancie sú dátumy v slede platieb takmer náhodné a nie je v nich mesačná periodicita ani s vysokou toleranciou posunu mzdy o niekoľko dní.\n",

    "Klasifikovali sme, pri ktorých platbách sa s akou pravdepodobnosťou jedná o mzdu. Predostreli sme metódu klasterizácie na identifikáciu 2 skupín transakcií medzi 2 účtami. Stratili sme dodatočnú informáciu o reťazcoch platieb nepoužitím grafovej štruktúry, no pre príjmy fyzických osôb to nepovažujeme za kritický problém. Naše percentuálne vyhodnotenie pravdepodobnosti, či je platba mzdou považujeme za približne správne aj kvôli poslednému grafu.\n",
    "Vysoké percento pravdepodobnosti, že sa jedná o mzdu dostávame pri sumách, ktoré reálne môžu byť mzdou. Naše riešenie vykazuje možnú chybovosť pri nízkych hodnotách miezd, v okolí 15 000kč. Peak v okolí 110 000kč je buď zlá kategorizácia z našej strany alebo chyba simulácie.\n",
